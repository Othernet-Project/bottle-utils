    Base form class to be subclassed. To define a new form subclass this

        class NewForm(Form):
            field1 = Field('Field 1')
            field2 = Field('Field 2', [Required])

    Forms support field pre- and post-procesors. These methods are named after
    the field names by prepending ``preprocess_`` and ``postprocess_``
    respectively. For example::

        class NewForm(Form):
            field1 = Field('Field 1')
            field2 = Field('Field 2', [Required])

            def preprocess_field1(self, value):
                return value.replace('this', 'that')

            def postprocess_field1(self, value):
                return value + 'done'

    Preprocessors can be defined for individual fields, and are ran before any
    validation happens over the field's data. Preprocessors are also allowed
    to raise ``ValidationError``, though their actual purpose is to perform
    some manipulation over the incoming data, before it is passed over to the
    validators. The return value of the preprocessor is the value that is going
    to be validated further.

    Postprocessors perform a similar purpose as preprocessors, except that they
    are invoked after field-level validation passes. Their return value is the
    value that is going to be the stored as cleaned / validated data.
