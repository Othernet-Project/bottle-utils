Bottle utils
============

Assortment of frequently used utilities for Bottle.

This package contains utilities for developing web sites and web applications
using Bottle_ framework. It is divided into 5 modules of
which the ``lazy`` module is not Bottle-specific.

The bottle-utils are created from a bunch of unrelated modules we frequently
used at Outernet_. Some of the modules have been tested fairly thoroughly, and
some have been used only in a handful of projects. Therefore, not all modules
are of high quality. You should conisder this package Alpha quality.

Status
======

bottle-utils is still in early development.

=======

The following modules are currently available:

- ``bottle_utils.ajax`` - Decorators for AJAX-specific handlers

Separately, there is also a module that contains shared low-level functionality
